      <h2>Five Business Models Driving the Circular Economy</h2>
      <p>These business models have their own distinct characteristics and can be used singly or in combination to help companies achieve massive resource productivity gains and, in the process, enhance differentiation and customer value, reduce cost to serve and own, generate new revenue, and reduce risk.</p>
      <div class="model">
        <h3>Circular Supplies</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Circular Supplies</strong> business model is based on supplying fully renewable, recyclable, or biodegradable resource inputs that underpin circular production and consumption systems. Through it, companies replace linear resource approaches and phase out the use of scarce resources while cutting waste, and removing inefficiencies. This model is most powerful for companies dealing with scarce commodities or ones with a major environmental footprint.</p>

        <h3>Resource Recovery</h3>
        <p><strong>Recovery of embedded value</strong> at the end of one product lifecycle to feed into another promotes return chains and transforms waste into value through innovative recycling and upcycling services. Having its bedrock in traditional recycling markets this business model leverage new technologies and capabilities to recover almost any type of resource output ata level of value equivalent to, or even above, that of the initial investment. Solutions range from industrial symbiosis to integrated closed loops recycling and <a href="https://www.c2ccertified.org/" class="link">Cradle-to-Cradle®</a> designs where disposed products can be reprocessed into new. This model, which enables a company to eliminate material leakage and maximize economic value of product return flows, is a good fit for companies that produce large volumes of by-product or where waste material from products can be reclaimed and reprocessed cost effectively.</p>
        <h3>Product Life Extension</h3>
        <p><strong>Product Life Extension</strong> allows companies to extend the lifecycle of products and assets. Values that would otherwise be lost through wasted materials are instead maintained or even improved by repairing, upgrading, remanufacturing or remarketing products. And additional revenue is generated thanks to extended usage. Using this model, a company can help ensure that products stay economically useful for as long as possible and that product upgrades are done in a more targeted way (for instance, an outdated component is replaced instead of the entire product). This model is appropriate for most capital-intensive B2B segments (such as industrial equipment) and B2C companies that serve markets where pre-owned products (or “recommerce”) are common or whose new releases of a product typically generate only partial additional performance benefits for customers over the previous version.</p>

        <h3>Sharing Platforms</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Sharing Platforms</strong> business model promotes a platform for collaboration among product users, either individuals or organizations. These facilitate the sharing of overcapacity or underutilization, increasing productivity and user value creation. This model, which helps maximize utilization, could benefit companies whose products and assets have a low utilization or ownership rate. However, today it’s most commonly found among companies specializing in increasing the utilization rate of products without doing any manufacturing themselves, putting considerable stress on traditional manufacturers.<p>

          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Product as a Service</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Product as a Service</strong> business model provides an alternative to the traditional model of “buy and own.” Products are used by one or many customers through a lease or pay-for-use arrangement. This business model turns incentives for product durability and upgradability upside down, shifting them from volume to performance. With a Product as a Service business model, product longevity, reusability, and sharing are no longer seen as cannibalization risks, but instead, drivers of revenues and reduced costs. This model would be attractive to companies whose products’ cost of operation share is high and that have a skill advantage relative to their customers in managing maintenance of products (giving them an edge in selling services and recapturing residual value at end of life).</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Moving toward a circular economy can be daunting. Yet, by adopting circular economy principles, more and more companies are gaining real competitive advantage: Getting ahead of rivals by innovating for both resource efficiency and customer value—and creating change at the intersection of a company’s strategy, technology and operations. In the face of runaway resource scarcity and rising customer and policy expectations for better, more sustainable products, there’s never been a better time to start. By developing a proactive strategy—built on a clear understanding of the motivation to leave behind the linear model and underpinned by the business models, technologies and capabilities critical to success—companies can create superior value and capture advantage - Circular Advantage.</p>
